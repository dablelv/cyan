# Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send a email to 1589276509@qq.com to report security related issues.

Please use a descriptive title for your report.

In addition, please include the following information along with your report:

- Your name and affiliation (if any).
- A description of the technical details of the vulnerabilities. It is very important to let us know how we can reproduce your findings.
- A minimal example of the vulnerabity.
- An explanation of who can exploit this vulnerability, and what they gain when doing so -- write an attack scenario. This will help us evaluate your report quickly, especially if the issue is complex.
- Whether this vulnerability is public or known to third parties. If it is, please provide details.

After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and announcement. We use the following disclosure process:

- When a report is received, we confirm the issue and determine its severity. Please try to maximize impact in the report, going beyond just obtaining unwanted behavior in a fuzzer.
- If we know of specific third-party services or software based on TensorFlow that require mitigation before publication, those projects will be notified.
- An security advisory is prepared (but not published) which details the problem and steps for mitigation.
- The vulnerability is fixed and potential workarounds are identified.
- We will publish a security advisory for all fixed vulnerabilities.

For each vulnerability, we try to ingress it as soon as possible, given the size of the team and the number of reports. Vulnerabilities will, in general, be batched to be fixed as soon as possible.

Past security advisories are listed in the GitHub's Security Advisory.
